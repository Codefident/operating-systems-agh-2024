"It was the largest World of Trucks event we've ever produced, incomparable with anything previously attempted.
We wanted something more engaging and visually stimulating than previous Christmas events, but the final result was
much larger than what we initially discussed," says Gavin, our game designer.
The discussions about the Christmas event first took place in November 2022, so more than a year before its release.
"The initial idea we had for this project was to create a wintery and magical depot, impressive in looks, with an environment
attractive enough that you would be willing to come back to it for the duration of the event, with three portal entrances
offering different routes to reach the depot," Gavin shares with us.
An event this big required everyone to chip in to make it on time so we could deliver the Winterland to our community in
perfect shape. "A lot of people were involved! There were sixty people in the event channel on our
internal communication platform. On the whole, the event called upon many disciplines; gameplay and event design,
production, map design, asset design and research, vehicles, technical art, programming, audio design, 2D graphic design,
quality assurance, and marketing. It was the incredible effort made by all the teams that made
this event possible," Gavin tells us.
